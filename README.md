## My process

I created a section and assigned a class value "wrapper" to it. I then created a div (class="container") inside the wrapper to house all the content of the qr code component. Using CSS flexbox, I aligned the wrapper horignally and vertically to the center of the screen. I changed the image to a block element so I can easily align it to the center and gave the container a uniform padding of 15px. To get the title and description to match or close to the original desgin, I had to use right left padding of 15px.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to add shadows to elements using the `box-shadow` CSS property.

```html
<div class="box shadow">ðŸŽ‰</div>
```
```css
.box {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  color: blue:
}

.shadow {
  box-shadow: 0px 0px 10px 5px blue;
}
```

### Continued development

Javascript is proving to be my greatest nightmare and I'm going to keep learning it. I want to also improve on my css skills and learn how to use the calc function and more ways to use flexbox and grid.
